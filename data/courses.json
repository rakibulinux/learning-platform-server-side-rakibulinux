    "details": "The #1 bestselling HTML and CSS course on Rakib Learning! Completely re-built from scratch in July 2021 (35+ hours video) Having gone through other related courses on other platforms, I can say this course is the most practical and readily applicable course on web design and development I have taken. â€” Bernie Pacis Open a new browser tab, type in www.rakibulinux.com, and take a look around. I will wait here... ... Amazing, right? What if you knew exactly how to design and build a website like that, completely from scratch? How amazing would that be? Well, I'm here to teach you HTML, CSS, and web design, all by building the stunning website that you just saw, step-by-step. So, after finishing this course, you will know exactly how to build a beautiful, professional, and ready-to-launch website just like rakibulinux, by following a 7-step process. And it will even look great on any computer, tablet, and smartphone. But what if you want to build a completely different website? Well, no problem! I designed the course curriculum with exactly this goal: to enable you to design and build any website that you can think of, not just copy the course project. So, in order to become a confident and independent developer, capable of building your own websites in the future, you will learn: The fundamentals of modern and semantic HTML, CSS, and building layouts in a small separate project, which will prepare you for the main course project (www.rakibulinux.com). This includes modern flexbox and CSS Grid! How to design beautiful websites, by learning a web design framework I created just for this course. It consists of easy-to-use guidelines for design aspects like typography, colors, images, spacing, and more (this is like a small standalone course!). How to use well-established website components and layout patterns in order to come up with professional-looking designs How to make any website work on any mobile device, no matter the design and layout (responsive design) How to use the 7 steps of building a professional website in practice: planning, sketching, designing, building, testing, optimizing, and launching How to find and use free design assets such as images, fonts, and icons Important developer skills such as reading documentation, fixing code errors on your own, and using professional web development tools Does this sound like fun? Then join me and 200,000+ other developers and start building websites today! Or are you not sold yet and need to know more? No problem, just keep reading... [01] Why should you learn HTML and CSS in the first place? Building websites allows you to do fun and creative work, from anywhere in the world, and it even pays well. Web development is one of the most future-proof and highest-paying industries in the world. And HTML and CSS is the entry point to this world! But you already know all this, that's why you want to learn HTML and CSS too. Well, you came to the right place! This is the best and most complete course for starting your web development journey that you will find on RakibPL. It's an all-in-one package that takes you from knowing nothing about HTML and CSS, to building beautiful websites using tools and technologies that professional web developers use every single day. [02] Why is this course so unique and popular? Reason #1: The course is completely project-based Simple demos are boring, and therefore you're gonna learn everything by building actual projects! In the final project (www.rakibulinux.com), together we hand-code a beautiful and responsive landing page for a fictional company that I made up just for the course. Reason #2: You will not just learn how to code Coding is great, but it's not everything! That's why we will go through the entire 7-step process of building and launching our website project. So the huge rakibulinux project will teach you real-world skills to build real-world HTML and CSS websites: how to plan projects and page layouts, how to implement designs using HTML and CSS techniques, how to write clean and organized code, how to optimize websites for good speed performance, and many more. On top of that, this course has a huge focus on beautiful design. In fact, this is the only course on the market that focuses on both coding and designing, together. Reason #3: I'm the right teacher for you With the right guidance and a well-structured curriculum, building websites can be quite easy and fun to learn. With a bunch of random tutorials and YouTube videos? Not so much. And that's where I come in. My name is Jonas, I'm an experienced web developer and designer, and one of RakibPL's top instructors. I have been teaching this bestselling course since 2015 to over 200,000 developers, always listening to feedback and understanding exactly how students actually learn. Using that feedback, I recently rebuilt this course from scratch and designed the ideal course curriculum for every type of student. It's a unique blend of projects, deep explanations, theory lectures, and challenges. I'm sure you're gonna love it! [03] Why is this course so long? Reason #1: I take time to explain every single concept that I teach, so that you actually learn, and not just copy code from the screen (this is a course, not a tutorial) Reason #2: I go into topics that other HTML and CSS courses shy away from: professional web design, component and layout patterns, some CSS theory, website planning in theory and practice, and developer skills. I believe you need all of this to be successful! Reason #3: There is a lot of repetition, so that you actually assimilate and practice what you learn. Practice is the single most important ingredient to learning, and therefore I provide plenty of opportunities for you to sharpen your skills [04] Here is what's also included in the package: Up-to-date HD-quality videos, that are easy to search and reference (great for RakibPL Business students) Professional English captions (not the auto-generated ones) Downloadable design assets + starter code and final code for each section Downloadable slides for 20+ theory videos (not boring, I promise!) Access to countless free design and development resources that I curated over many years Free support in the course Q&A 10+ coding challenges to practice your new skills (solutions included) [05] This course is for you if... ... you are a complete beginner with no idea of how to build a website. ... you already know a bit of HTML and CSS from some tutorials or videos, but struggle to put together a good-looking, complete website. ... you are a designer and want to expand your skills into HTML and CSS, because all your designer friends are learning how to code (they are smart!). Basically, if you are an HTML and CSS master, and build the most beautiful websites in the world, then DON'T take the course. Everyone else: you should take the course, today. So, does all of this sound great? Then join me and 200,000+ other developers and start your web development journey today! Who this course is for: Complete beginners who want to learn how to build a professional, beautiful and responsive website Students with some knowledge about HTML and CSS, but who struggle to put together a great website Designers who want to expand their skill set into HTML5 and CSS3"

    "details": "MongoDB is one of the most important NoSQL databases you can work with these days. It's extremely popular and MongoDB developers are in high demand. No matter if you're building web applications, mobile applications or any other kind of application or if you're a data scientist - you'll need to work with data. Storing data, querying it efficiently and minimizing complexities whilst optimizing performance are crucial tasks. MongoDB makes working with data simple - it's built on a philosophy that prioritizes performance and efficiency. In this course, you'll learn all about MongoDB from scratch. No prior MongoDB or database experience is required! In detail, you'll learn: ... how to install and use MongoDB locally and in the cloud (MongoDB Atlas) ... how to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on MongoDB databases ... how to filter for data efficiently ... how to work with both the Mongo Shell and drivers (e.g. Node.js driver) ... how to increase performance by using indexes (and how to use the right indexes!) ... how to use the amazing Aggregation Framework that's built into MongoDB ... what replica sets and sharding are ... how to use MongoDB Atlas - the cloud solution offered by MongoDB ... how to use the serverless platform (Stitch) offered by MongoDB ... and much more! This course is a hands-on course - you'll learn by writing code/ commands. We'll work on a wide variety of example data and use-cases and by the end of the course, you'll have all the knowledge you need to work with MongoDB in your next project! This course is for you, no matter which programming language you plan on using, you'll learn a uniform way of interacting with MongoDB that can be easily applied to any language. This course is for you: ... if you're brand-new to MongoDB and databases in general ... if you got some basic database or even MongoDB experience - in this course, there are different entry points you can choose from! ... if you are a web or mobile app (or desktop app) developer who considers using MongoDB ... if you're working in a team that considers using MongoDB (or already does use it) ... if you are primarily using SQL-based databases so far and you want to explore the most popular NoSQL alternative This course is NOT for you: ... if you're looking for a guide on administrating MongoDB servers => This course focuses on the commands/ queries you write, it's NOT an administration course. I will show (in detail) how to deploy a ready-to-use cloud MongoDB solution that follows best practices though."

    "details": "One of the first things you're going to learn in any node course is about the Express module. But how much do you really learn about it? How to render a page in one template engine? How to make a get and a post route? Most MEAN and MERN stacks students I've met learned Express in a few breaths and then moved on to MongoDB, MySQL, Angular, React, or whatever was in the rest of the tech stack. What is http anyway? Should I even care? It's easy to get 2 inches deep and find you've accomplished your task, but in fact have no idea why it works or how you'd go further. That, in my opinion, is no good for someone who wants to be a great developer. I've had a lot of students ask for a course on just Express js because they were either overwhelmed when they learned it, or they can't find any detail on it to go further than beginner knowledge. That's what this course is for. We will go through the various pieces of Express in detail so you can know why it behaves the way it does and get the most out of it. Express 5 is currently in alpha, so when it hits beta or full release, and as questions come up, the course will expand accordingly! Note: this course is not a quick path to launch a webapp with Express/Node. You can get that in 10 minutes in many other places. This course is meant to take a longer, deeper look at what Express js actually does. I've been using Express since V.2, in 2012 and have seen it do just about everything. It is one of my favorite node modules and consistently one of the most downloaded on npm. There are other awesome technologies that patch into Express that get easily missed. This course will naturally lead into other things like websockets, webRTC, etc. Prepare for one of the most awesome node modules on npm! Sections: Environment Setup (skip if you have node installed already) Before Express... - TCP & HTTP, making an express-less node server Express 101 - Making a basic web sever with Express Express 201 - Middleware and Rendering Express 301 - Req & Res revisited, the router, and the express generator Rendering Project API Project Passport (jwt & local strategy still coming) Best Practices (Coming...) Supplemental - connecting to various DBs (very basic - only for those already familiar with a database) Who this course is for: Beginner node developers who want to learn Express but overwhelmed by full MERN or MEAN courses Beginner node developers who need a review of JUST Express js Developers who want to go into the various pieces of Express in a little more depth without having to look at the docs Developers interested in using node as a webserver or using web sockets with Express"
